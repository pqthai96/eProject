        "Question": "How do I clean my ring?",
        "Answer": "It is best to have your jewelry professionally cleaned by Rock Paradise or another jeweler. For a simple cleaning at home, we recommend mixing Dawn dish soap in warm water, soaking your ring or other jewelry for five minutes, and using a soft bristled baby toothbrush to gently clean behind stones or settings. Air dry, then finish with a polishing cloth. We do not recommend chemical jewelry cleaners because they can damage certain stones."

        "Question": "Should I have my gemstone settings checked?",
        "Answer": "All gemstone rings, especially those with prong settings, should be checked for security annually and worn with relative care. We use our hands constantly, and bumps to the stone or metal can cause shifts and looseness. Rough diamonds are not designed for jewelry in the way cut diamonds are. For that reason, they should be worn with extra care and checked frequently to be sure the prongs are tight and the diamond is secure."

        "Question": "Can my enamel ring be repaired?",

        "Question": "How do I best care and maintain my new jewelry purchase?",
        "Answer": "We offer complimentary cleaning and product check-up (recommended every six months) as a well-advised preemptive measure against the possibility of stone loss or damage that occurs when prongs are bent, pulled, caught, or broken during normal wear. If a deeper clean is necessary we only ask that you cover the shipping and insurance to safely transport the ring to our facility in Dubai. And as a gesture of gratitude for choosing Rock Paradise Jewelry, we’ll cover the shipping back to you."
